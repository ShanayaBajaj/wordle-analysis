Wordle Strategy & Engagement Analysis

This project explores user behavior and gameplay patterns around Wordle, the popular word puzzle game. Using engagement data and exploratory data analysis (EDA), the project uncovers insights on player tendencies, difficulty levels, and optimal strategies.

Key Highlights:
- Cleaned and processed a real engagement dataset related to Wordle players
- Performed EDA to identify patterns in guess attempts, letter frequency, and win rates
- Built visualizations to showcase guessing strategies and performance trends
- Explored potential modeling techniques for predicting the next Wordle word based on day-of-week and player history (in `wordle_prediction_model.ipynb`)
- Useful for understanding user engagement and behavioral gamification strategies

This analysis can be extended to build recommendation engines, AI Wordle solvers, or evaluate language game complexity through data.
